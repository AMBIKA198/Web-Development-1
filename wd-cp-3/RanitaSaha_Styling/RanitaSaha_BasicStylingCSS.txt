
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a web design tool used to manage a web page's purpose, while HTML trades with genuine content.
 Using CSS, the user can check the color of the text, fonts' style, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and placed out.

Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if the user sets the color of the body text to "green," all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless we specify something else)!

the basic styling of Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
