# :confused: ***What is CSS?*** :confused:
 
 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a web design tool used to manage a web page's purpose, while HTML trades with genuine content.
 Using CSS, the user can check the color of the text, fonts' style, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and placed out.

  The following are the advantages of CSS âˆ’
-CSS preserves time. The user can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. The user can define each HTML element's style and apply it to as many Web pages as the user wants it to be.
-The user can be downloaded numerous times the updated web page. For our website's goal of using CSS, the user will see significant improvements in our web page download times. With CSS, the user can succeed at more accelerated download rates than with tables.
-CSS is the most accessible website management. Using CSS for style and layout, the user has to adjust one style sheet to improve. Table-based configurations demand each web page be modified. So CSS is less time-consuming. E.g., if we had a 100-page website, it would take a long time to adjust if it used tables but would take no time when we are using CSS.

-CSS is Web page user-friendly because an alternative CSS document can be called again when a user wishes to print a web page. This report can define that only the content and logo appear on the printout, with the navigation and formatting made to go.
-CSS is to be announced as Global web standards since HTML characteristics are being deprecated, and it is always better to use CSS. So it's an excellent concept to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them cooperative in future browsers.
-CSS is Program Independence. The Script offers uniform program independence and can support the latest browsers also.
